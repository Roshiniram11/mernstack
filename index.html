        A bicycle is a fun and healthy way to move around. 
        It has two wheels, one behind the other, with a seat and handlebars to steer. 
        You pedal with your feet to make it go. Bicycles come in different sizes and colors. 
        Some have baskets to carry things, others have bells to ring. People use bicycles for exercise, to go to school, or to enjoy a ride in the park.
        Itâ€™s important to wear a helmet for safety when riding.
        Bicycles are good for the environment too, as they do not cause pollution like cars.
